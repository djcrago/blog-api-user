This website is one of three connected projects. The other two projects include a backend API and a website for the blog author to create, edit, and delete blog posts.

The contents of this repository were copied from a central repository housing all three projects for the sake of deployment. Each frontend website was copied into its own repository so that it could be deployed on GitHub pages more easily. The main repository can be found here: https://github.com/djcrago/blog-api
