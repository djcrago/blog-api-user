This directory houses the user-facing web app where visitors can read and comment on posts written by the blog author.

Visitors are unable to create, edit, or delete posts or comments.

A "public" route is accessed which only provides posts the author has published (not drafts they haven't yet).

Other aspects of this directory include:

- Modularizing code for the sake of readability and clarity
